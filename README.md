# Cloud Gox

A Go (golang) Cross-Compiler in the cloud

* Embedded realtime front-end
* Automatic multi-platform Github releases
* Uses Go 1.5 (no toolchain builds required)
* Compile your favourite command-line tools from the browser

### Demo

#### http://gox.jpillora.com/

### Install

**Binaries**

See [the latest release](https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-gox/releases/latest)

**Source**

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/cloud-gox
```

### Deploy

1. Click this button to deploy **cloud-gox** for free on Heroku

	[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

1. Optionally add **HTTP authentication credentials**

1. Optionally add your **Github credentials**

	Github web-hooks sent from the **specified user** to `cloud-gox` will create a new Github release inside **the source repository** for **specified tag** and then each of the compiled binaries will be uploaded as release assets. Once you've set `GH_USER` and `GH_PASS` environment variables, you can setup any of your repositories for automatic releases:

	1. Go to `https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/settings/hooks`
	1. Click the `Add Webhook` button
	1. Set the `Payload URL` to `http://<cloud-gox-location>/hook` (see optional `params` below)
	1. Again, click the `Add Webhook` button
	1. Now, pushing git tags will trigger a new release and your app will be cross-compiled and uploaded to Github

	You can customize your web-hook using query parameters (e.g. `/hook?foo=bar`). You can set:

	* a `versionvar` parameter to change the ldflags variable (defaults to `VERSION`)
	* a `osarch` parameter which provides a comma separated list of build platforms, each platform must be in the form `os/arch`
	* a `target` parameter which provides a comma separated list of each command-line tool within your package (e.g. `target=cmd/foo` will build `<repo>/cmd/foo`)

#### Todo

* Run parallel builds
* Add dynamic Godeps support
* Verify Github signed web-hooks

#### Notes

I've [forked Heroku's Go buildpack](https://github.com/jpillora/heroku-buildpack-go) in order to keep the local copy of the Go tools (Heroku's version keeps them only in the build cache).
