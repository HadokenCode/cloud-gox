# cloud-gox

A Go (Golang) Cross-Compiler in the Cloud

### Deploy

1. Deploy your own **cloud-gox**

	[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Add both or one:

	* Bintray credentials -  All webbrowser 'compiles' will be uploaded to 'bintray.com/<user>/cloud-gox/releases'
		* Existing files are not overwritten
	* Github credentials - Create tag webhooks sent from <user> to `https://<app>.herokuapp.com/hooks?params` will trigger a cross-compile and a release will be created
		* `params` can contain `constraints` (defaults to `linux,darwin,windows`) and also any number of `target` compile directories (defaults to ["."]) - there should be one target per command-line utility.

3. After the toolchain compiles, you can now use it
