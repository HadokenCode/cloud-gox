# Cloud GoX

A Go (Golang) Cross-Compiler in the Cloud

### Demo

1. Visit https://cloud-gox.herokuapp.com/
1. Compile your Go package
1. Find results https://dl.bintray.com/jpillora/cloud-gox/

### Deploy

1. Deploy your own **cloud-gox**

	[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

1. Add either or both:

	* **Bintray credentials** -  All web browser 'compiles' will be uploaded to `https://dl.bintray.com/<user>/cloud-gox/'
		* You will need to create a `cloud-gox` repo and inside, a `releases` package
		* Existing files are not overwritten
	* **Github credentials** - Git tag creation webhooks sent from **user** to `https://<app>.herokuapp.com/hooks?params` will trigger a cross-compile and a release will be created
		* `params` can contain `constraints` (defaults to `linux,darwin,windows`) and also any number of `target` compile directories (defaults to ["."]) - there should be one target per command-line utility.

1. After the toolchain compiles (`Installed commands in /app/jp/go/bin`), it's ready to use

### Notes

* **cloud-gox** will use `ldflags` to set your `VERSION` variable to your compile version.
* **cloud-gox** does not currently use authentication, if you want to keep your cloud-gox app private, use a complicated app name and always use HTTPS.
* **cloud-gox** will log extra error information, which you can tail from Heroku with `heroku logs --tail --app <app>`.
